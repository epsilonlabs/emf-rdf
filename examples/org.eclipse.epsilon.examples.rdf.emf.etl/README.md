# ETL example

This is an example project of an [ETL](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/etl/) model-to-model transformation using the RDF resource.

Two launch files are provided:

* The `(EPackage by URI)` requires registering the `01-base.emf` and `02-combined.emf` metamodels first in Eclipse.
  With [Eclipse Emfatic](https://eclipse.dev/emfatic/) installed, this can be done by right-clicking on the file from the "Package Explorer" or "Project Explorer" and selecting "Register EPackages".
* The `(use Emfatic files)` option only requires having installed Emfatic. It will directly load and register those metamodels for the transformation.

Note that due to limitations in the resource, the target model must have "Read on load" enabled.
You will need to make sure that `target.ttl` contains no statements before it runs, otherwise the transformation will produce incorrect results.
